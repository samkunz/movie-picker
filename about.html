<h3><u>Background</u></h3>

<!-- <p>
    “Recommendation Algorithms” can be quite unhelpful.
    <br>
    <br>
    I often care less about the average 5 star rating from some random set of 
    strangers, and more about whether the movie has attributes that I'm 
    interested in.
    <br>
    <br>
    And based on my mood, those interests change.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>This isn't an Algorithm. It's a filtering tool.</i></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    I haven't found a good tool to create lists of movies with precise control 
    over how those lists are generated. 
    <br>
    <br>
    So... I'm making that tool.

<h3><u>Technical Details</u></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Django (Python, HTML, CSS) for core logic, web page templating, 
        database integration.</li>
    <li>Postgres for the database.</li>
    <li>Heroku for deployment/hosting.</li>
    <li>Python for data processing scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Roadmap</u></h3>

<p>
You may have noticed there are a limited number of "Priorities",
and a limited number of "Items" for each "Priority". You may have also
noticed that even for the existing "Items", movies you'd expect to appear
in Step 3 are missing.
</p>
<p>
The app is a prototype, and I'm planning to complete the existing data, 
and add more movies, Priorities, and Items soon.
</p>
<p>
Some new Items top of mind: Academy Award for Screenwriting, more awards from
AAFCA and AWFJ, specific directors, specific actors/actresses, 
Palme d'Or (Cannes), and manually curated lists of "vibes" 
(e.g. cyberpunk, espionage, fantasy, medieval, sci-fi, etc).
</p>
<p>
I'm also planning some other interface and usage improvements, but let's 
not get too far ahead of ourselves.
